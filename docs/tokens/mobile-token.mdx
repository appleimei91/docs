MOBILE was the protocol token of the [Helium Mobile Network][mobile]. MOBILE was introduced to the
Helium Network through the community proposal [HIP-53][hip-53] and was further defined in subsequent
HIPs<sup>(</sup>[^1]<sup>,</sup>[^2]<sup>,</sup>[^3]<sup>,</sup>[^4]<sup>)</sup>.

:::important MOBILE emissions ceased on January 29, 2025, in accordance with [HIP-138][hip-138].

Network participants are directly rewarded in HNT tokens from the HNT awarded to the MOBILE Network
by the utility score.

MOBILE Tokens remain redeemable for HNT via the Subnetwork Treasury pool allocated during the MOBILE
emission period.

:::

## Token Brief

The MOBILE token was mined by 5G-CBRS and WiFi Hotspots through both data transfer proceeds as well as 
Proof of Coverage. MOBILE tokens could also optionally be earned from locking HNT tokens to participate in
Helium MOBILE Network governance.

The mint address for MOBILE is [`mb1eu7TzEc71KxDpsmsKoucSSuuoGLv1drys1oP2jh6`][mobile-mint-addr] on
the Solana blockchain.

## Redemption for HNT

Protocol tokens like MOBILE will always be backed by HNT and will convert to HNT even after the return
to issuing HNT rewards directly. To enable this, each network within the Helium Network is allocated
a pool of HNT based on the Network Utility Score.

The redemption ratio is set algorithmically by treasury swap contracts. It can be calculated easily
by dividing the
[current total amount of MOBILE tokens in existence](https://solscan.io/token/mb1eu7TzEc71KxDpsmsKoucSSuuoGLv1drys1oP2jh6)
by the current amount of
[HNT in the MOBILE Network treasury](https://solscan.io/account/AguTdjmW5SkhepT9qsKsj29SEqiVKsJchsap6Kma9i98).
The result tells how many MOBILE is required to be burned to receive each HNT token from the network
treasury.

$$\text{MOBILE per HNT} = \frac{\text{Total amount of MOBILE tokens existing}}{\text{Total amount of HNT in MOBILE treasury}}$$

Although the MOBILE token has ceased minting, there is still a daily distribution of HNT to the 
MOBILE Treasury as [HIP-138][hip-138] defined an emission of 2.9M HNT to the MOBILE treasury, distributed 
daily as an  amount of **12,236.28691983** HNT until the havening on August 1st 2025. After that date 
the redemption or floor rate of MOBILE to HNT will stabilize, until then floor rate of MOBILE to HNT 
is decreasing. As long as there is HNT in the MOBILE treasury, the MOBILE token will 
have a value.

No automatic or required migration from MOBILE to HNT is planned.

The [Helium Wallet App][wallet-app] serves as the primary platform for exchanging MOBILE to HNT.
This transaction can also be performed directly through the Solana blockchain using the open-source
tooling found in the [Helium GitHub repositories][github].

## Token Allocation

MOBILE follows a similar minting schedule to HNT, however at a max supply of 230,000,000,000 (230B).
50B MOBILE were pre-mined at the launch of the Mobile Network and distributed to the Network
operations fund administered by the Helium Foundation. A fraction of this allocation was distributed
throughout the Genesis period to live Mobile Network Hotspots. Year 1 for MOBILE started on August
1st, 2022 with the first tokens minted on August 12th, 2022.

The issuance was scheduled to have halvings every 2 years, aligning with HNT issuance halvings. From January 
2025 the emissions percentages will remain the same but rewards will be directly in the HNT Token.

The emission schedule was created in [HIP-53][hip-53-emissions], updated in
[HIP-75][hip-75-emissions], confirmed in [HIP-77][hip-77-emissions] and updated in [HIP-79][hip-79].
It is as follows:
