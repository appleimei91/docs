The Helium Network Token (HNT) is the native cryptocurrency and protocol token of the Helium
Network.

The original Helium blockchain produced the first HNT on July 29th, 2019, on block 93. There was no
pre-mine of HNT before the launch of the Network. The Helium network migrated to the Solana
Blockchain on April 18, 2023.

The mint address for HNT is [`hntyVP6YFm1Hg25TN9WGLqM12b8TQmcknKrdu1oxWux`][hnt-mint-addr] on the
Solana blockchain.

## HNT Usage

HNT serves the needs of the two primary parties in the Helium Ecosystem:

1. **Hotspot Hosts and Operators**. Hosts are rewarded in HNT network tokens while deploying and 
    maintaining network coverage. Operators, and some network mappers are also rewarded in HNT.
2. **Enterprises and Developers use the Helium Network** to connect devices and build Network
   applications. [Data Credits][datacredit], which are a \$USD-pegged utility token derived from
   HNT, are used to pay transaction fees for wireless data transmissions on the Network.

## HNT Token Economic Concepts

The Network uses three token economic concepts to ensure HNT supply is both plentiful for usage
needs and relatively scarce, with a known maximum.

### Max Supply

The Network targeted the distribution of 5,000,000 HNT per month at launch. Following the community
approval of HIP-20, the Network uses a two-year halving schedule, resulting in a maximum HNT supply
of 240,000,000 HNT, **but slow blockchain times in year 1 resulted in emissions of ~43,000,000
resulting in a max supply of ~223,000,000 HNT.

    Year 1 starts on **August 1st, 2019**. The first halving happened on day one of year three,
    **August 1st, 2021**.

### Burn and Mint Economics {#burn-and-mint-economics}

[Data Credits][datacredit] (DC) are a $USD-pegged utility token derived from HNT and is used to pay
fees on the Helium Network. DC is only produced by burning HNT. This HNT to DC relationship is based
on a design commonly called a [burn and mint equilibrium][bme] and intends to allow for the supply
of HNT to respond to network usage trends.

### Net Emissions

As the halving schedule progresses, it is possible that the HNT minted per epoch is not sufficiently
divisible for data transfer rewards. Therefore, in order to ensure that miners are incentivized to
continue transmitting data and ensure a healthy, robust network, the Net Emissions mechanism was
instituted in August 2021.

Net Emissions give the protocol enough HNT for rewards in perpetuity by monitoring the number of HNT
burned for DC in a given epoch and adding that to the number of HNT to mint that epoch. Because HNT
produced via Net Emissions do not add to the total outstanding, they do not violate max supply.
However, to ensure that the deflationary pressure is still present, the Net Emission is capped at 1%
of the epoch emissions at the time when HIP 20 was approved.

Specifically, Net Emissions counts only HNT burned for Data Credits and does not count HNT 
programmatically burned for any other reason.

Review the [complete Net Emissions discussion in the HIP][hip-20] for more information. Note that in
HIP-20, the cap was 34.24 HNT because the epoch was every 30 minutes at the time HIP-20 was written.
The current epoch is only 24 hour basis, yielding a cap of 1,643.83561643 HNT.

The up-to-date value can be verified
[on chain at.](https://explorer.solana.com/address/BQ3MCuTT5zVBhNfQ4SjMh3NPVhFy73MPV8rjfq5d1zie/anchor-account) Move
the decimal point 8 positions left to measure `Net Emissions Cap` in HNT.

HIP-20 proposed a Net Emissions Pool, which would smooth out the effects of large individual burn 
events occurring infrequently over several days. Without smoothing, large HNT burns for DC would 
be extremely capped as the burn and cap would happen only on one day. This pool was implemented 
as part of [HRP 2025-03][hrp-2025-03] using a similar smoothing calcuation to that for the 
Utility Score described in [HIP-141][hip-141].

The smoothing calculation multiplies yesterdays uncapped and smoothed HNT burned for DC amount 
number and multiplies it by 6/7 and then adds it to todays actual HNT burned for DC amount multiplied 
by 1/7 and the resulting number then has the Net Emissions Cap applied to provide the calculated Net 
Emission HNT number for today. This has an effect that large burns on one day can increase Net 
Emissions over several days rather than just one day.

```
net_emissions_target(today) = net_emissions_target(yesterday) * 6/7 + hnt_burn(today) * 1/7

hnt_net_emissions(today) = min(net_emissions_target(today), 1,643.83561643)
```

#### Example 1

If yesterday's smoothed HNT burn for DC number was 400 HNT `net_emissions_target(yesterday)` and 
today's HNT burned for DC is 10,0000 HNT `hnt_burn(today)`, then the result is: (400 x 6/7) + 
(10,000 x 1/7) = 1,771.429 `net_emissions_target(today)`, but will be Max capped at 1,643.83561643 
HNT and become `hnt_net_emissions(today)`.

Therefore, 1,643.83561643 is today's actual HNT Net Emissions and as 10,000 - 1,643.83561643 
= 8,356.164384 then the net result is 8,356.164384 HNT will be burned today.

Tomorrow, the uncapped number `net_emissions_target(today)`(1,771.429) will become yesterday's 
smoothed HNT burn for DC number `net_emissions_target(yesterday)`. 

#### Example 2

If yesterday's smoothed HNT burn for DC number was 1,650 HNT and today's HNT burned for DC is 200 
HNT, then the result is: (1,650 x 6/7) + (200 x 1/7) = 1,442.857143 and is under the cap.

Therefore, 1,442.857143 is today's actual HNT Net Emissions, and as 200 is less than today's 
emissions, the net result is no HNT is burned.

Smoothing the HNT burn for DC from previous days to today has resulted in more HNT Net Emissions 
today than were HNT burned for DC today.

Tomorrow, the uncapped number (1,442.857143) will become yesterday's smoothed HNT burn for DC number.


#### Example 3

If yesterday's smoothed HNT burn for DC number was 1,440 HNT and today's HNT burned for DC is 
2,000 HNT, then the result is: (1,440 x 6/7) + (2,000 x 1/7) = 1,520 HNT and is under the cap

Therefore, 1,520 is today's actual Net Emission,s and 2,000 - 1,520 = 480 HNT will be burned 
today.


Tomorrow, the uncapped number (1,520) will become yesterday's smoothed HNT burn for DC number.
