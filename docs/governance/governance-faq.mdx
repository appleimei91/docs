## What Is veHNT?

veHNT represents the voting power in the Helium Network.

In the Helium ecosystem, HNT holders can establish a veHNT position by locking their HNT on-chain for a specified
period in exchange for voting rights and voting power in all areas of the Helium Network as defined 
in [HIP-51](https://github.com/helium/HIP/issues/336).

Additionally, this provides other benefits such as earning HNT tokens, requiring the holder to delegate 
their veHNT to those subnetworks and additionally regularly voting in Network proposals. 
After the lock-up period ends, the same amount of HNT is released back to the owner's wallet and is now 
transferable or tradeable as before.

## What are the requirements for earning HNT tokens with locked up HNT

People who lock up their HNT can use this staked veHNT to vote on proposals in the Helium Network and 
help the Network make collective decisions influencing the future of the Network. It is a requirement
that owners of locked up tokens vote for at least 2 of the most recent 4 veHNT votes or lose staking 
income, or alternatively they can assign a proxy to vote on their behalf.

Additionally, people who lock up their HNT are required to delegate their veHNT to a subnetwork to 
receive HNT token rewards. Delegating veHNT to a subnetwork is now the sole variable affecting the Network 
Utility Score that decides the split of HNT that gets distributed to the IoT and Mobile token emissions 
recipients as described in [HIP 141.](https://github.com/helium/HIP/blob/main/0141-single-token-governance-and-release-proposals.md)
Delegation of veHNT to a subnetwork earns the same for the staker no matter which subtoken they delegate 
towards.

## Where does my HNT Go if I Stake veHNT?

If you lock up your HNT, you will see a veHNT value and it will remain entirely in your wallet's
custody. veHNT ownership is represented by a non-transferable Solana NFT held in your wallet. At the
end of the lock-up period, any received tokens need to be claimed, the position undelegated, and
then after a close position action is taken you will receive HNT back to your wallet 1:1 for the HNT
you staked.

## What Is a "Lock-Up" Period?

A lock-up period is a window of time when users are not allowed to transfer their HNT.

You will incur a lock-up period when you stake your HNT for veHNT. The lock-up period is between 1
day and 48 months selectable in days but with block granularity.

Lock-up periods help incentivize long-term holders of HNT and deter short-term speculators and those
with shorter-term interests in the governance of the Network.

## What is Voting Power?

Voting power is the weight of your vote towards decisions made by the Network. The more veHNT you 
have, the more weight your vote has.

You can only increase your voting power by staking more HNT or extending an existing veHNT lock-up
period for longer.

## How to Choose a subnetwork to Stake?

[HIP-51](https://github.com/helium/HIP/blob/main/0051-helium-dao.md#omni-protocol-poc-incentive-model)
defines that all subnetworks return a maximum of 6% of their earnings to their veHNT delegators and
was designed to be an equal maximum reward level across all subnetworks so that no subnetwork can buy
their way to a higher Network Utility score. 

[HIP-141](https://github.com/helium/HIP/blob/main/0141-single-token-governance-and-release-proposals.md) updated the operation of this score.

As more veHNT is delegated to a subnetwork, the Network Utility Score improves, as defined in HIP-141, 
which drives greater earnings of HNT for the subnetwork participants. But the income from delegation
of your veHNT now remains dependant on the total emissions and delegations and is no longer dependant
on which specific network you are delegated towards.

As more veHNT holders delegate to a particular subnetwork, individual holder earnings will reduce
the amount of net subnetwork token earnings as delegators share the 6% subnetwork token emissions.

The more veHNT delegated to a subnetwork the more the subnetwork Utility score increases and the
more HNT the subnetwork gets at each epoch improving the HNT/subnetwork Token ratio. But the more
veHNT delegated, the more veHNT holders the 6% will have to be shared between.

## How Will Staking Work By Using veHNT?

Anyone can stake any amount of HNT and lock it up for 1 day to 1461 days ( 48 months). You choose
your unstaking date at the time of lock-up or decide to keep it on a rolling lock-up period, called
"constant lock-up" before initiating the start or the veHNT decay process. The HNT staked is
exchanged for veHNT, which currently provides two benefits:

- Voting in the Helium Network on new proposals and Participating in the Governance.
- Receiving an income if the veHNT is delegated to a subnetwork and voter participation.

Anyone can delegate veHNT to a subnetwork, it's now the only component of a subnetwork's Utility 
Score. 

The Helium Network encourages your long-term participation in voting and governance. Those who stake
HNT for 1 day will exchange 1:0.06844627 HNT to veHNT. Those that stake veHNT for 48 months will
receive an exchange of 1:100 HNT to veHNT. Any period in between will be treated on a linear scale
from 0.0684462 to 100.

> For example, I choose to lock up 10 HNT for six months. I receive 125 veHNT. If I decide to
> unstake immediately, after six months, my veHNT decays to 0 until my 10 HNT is unlocked and is
> available to me for use in my wallet.

A combination of an amount of HNT locked up for a specified duration and the assigned veHNT is
called a "Position". It is possible to own multiple Positions in your wallet. Actions taken on a
Position - like e.g. on the lock-up duration, delegating the veHNT, voting with the veHNT - are all
or nothing options. Each position could delegate to a different subnetwork. Similarly, wishing to 
extend the lock-up duration on parts of a Position requires a similar split by transfer.

## How Can I Obtain veHNT?

Locking up HNT for veHNT can be performed in the Helium Wallet App under the Governance Icon. 
Or at https://heliumvote.com/hnt and connecting your wallet.

## Is There a Staking "Genesis" Period?

For the first ten days after Helium's migration onto Solana, there was a 3x multiplier bonus for new
veHNT stakers. This is called the "Landrush" multiplier.

New stakers were only eligible to receive this veHNT bonus during the initial ten-day Landrush
period. HNT staked now, after this period will receive veHNT at the normal rate with no multiplier.

This landrush period ended at 23:59:59 UTC on April 28, 2023.

For example:

> Staking 10 HNT during this Landrush period with a lock duration of six months gets 375 veHNT
> (10x12.5x3) that, if a cooldown is selected, decays from 375 to 0 veHNT at the end of the staking
> period, and 10 HNT is returned to the wallet.

> Staking 20 HNT during this Landrush period with a lock duration of 24 months returns 3000 veHNT
> (20x50x3), and at the end of the staking period, 20 HNT is returned to the wallet.

## Will I Earn HNT by Staking For veHNT?

**Yes.** Since the implementation of HIP-141 rewards are now received in HNT and no longer in IOT or
MOBILE tokens.

## How much veHNT will I get for each lock-up period?

The table below shows the approximate HNT to veHNT multiplier for example months of staking

This value was multiplied by 3x during the first 10 days after the Solana transition and this
multiplier lasts as long as the last lock-up period selected in the first 10 days after the Solana
migration.

| Months staked | veHNT received |     | Months staked | veHNT received |
| :-----------: | :------------: | --- | :-----------: | :------------: |
|    1 week     |      0.5       |     |      12       |      25.0      |
|    2 weeks    |      1.0       |     |      15       |      31.2      |
|       1       |      2.0       |     |      18       |      37.5      |
|       2       |      4.1       |     |      21       |      43.7      |
|       3       |      6.2       |     |      24       |      50.0      |
|       4       |      8.3       |     |      27       |      56.2      |
|       5       |      10.4      |     |      30       |      62.5      |
|       6       |      12.5      |     |      33       |      68.7      |
|       7       |      14.5      |     |      36       |      75.0      |

|      10       |      20.8      |     |      45       |      93.7      |
|      11       |      22.9      |     |      48       |     100.0      |

## Do I Have to Delegate My veHNT to a subnetwork?

No. You can hold your veHNT as is or delegate to a subnetwork at any time.
But you will NOT receive HNT for locking your position if you do not delegate and vote.

:::note

Changing delegation is allowed, but you must be delegated at the end of an Epoch to earn 
rewards for that Epoch. If you undelegate ensure you redelegate to continue earning rewards.

## How Granular Is The veHNT Linear Decrease?

The veHNT decay countdown starts when initiated from the Wallet app/Helium Vote, either 
immediately in "decay" mode or after a "constant lockup" is unlocked and cooldown started.

veHNT quantity decay is granulated per second even though the Epoch period is 24 hours.

It is the current delegated veHNT value at the start of an Epoch that is used for calculating the
subnetwork utility score during the Epoch.

A 48-month lock-in period has approximately 1461 linear steps between 100 veHNT and 0 veHNT.

> 4 years x 365.25 days epochs per day = 1461 steps

After 1 day has passed after staking a single 1 HNT for 48 months, the quantity of veHNT in the
wallet will decay from 100 veHNT to 99.86311 veHNT. This decrease will recur linearly over the
remaining 48 months until it hits zero.

## Can I Increase My Staking Lock-up Period At Any Time?

Yes. You can increase your lock-up period by extending it to a maximum of 48 months at any time, and
the increase activates at the start of the next epoch. If the veHNT is delegated you must
undelegate, change the period, redelegate. This operation no longer loses a days rewards if the 
undelegate/redelegate operation is performed within the same epoch period.

## Can I Decrease My Staking Period For Fast Access to My HNT and Take a Penalty?

No. You define your lock-up period at the time of staking and cannot unstake or decrease the lock-up
period for any reason.

## What do I need to do to close a decayed veHNT position?

To completely close a position the following is required:

- Claim all rewards - you may need to keep claiming until the claim button is disabled.
- Undelegate your position 
- Close the position in the right epoch - You may need to wait until after the epoch has ended that the position closed in.
- Ensure there is a HNT account in your wallet - it is possible that the HNT account in the wallet has
been deleted. It can be recreated by transfering HNT into the wallet or swapping other tokens for any 
amount of HNT.

## Can I Automate Re-Staking?

Yes, a constant rolling lock-up period is available called Constant Lock-up. The decay countdown
start point will need positive action to start the lock-up cooldown period.

> Staking 10 HNT for 4 years will get approx 1000 veHNT (10x100) and this will be a rolling 4 year 
> period and will remain at 1000 veHNT until the decay countdown is activated and this will then 
> decrease linearly over 4 years to 0 veHNT and then the HNT can be claimed back.

## Can I Transfer my veHNT or any of the veDNTs to Someone Else?

No. veHNT and the like are fully non-transferable and represent your voting power in the Network. It
is not a token. It is represented in the wallet by a non-transferable NFT.

## How Do I Buy veHNT 

You cannot buy veHNT or move it between wallets. They are not tradable tokens. veHNT can only be obtained
by staking HNT with a lock-up period. 

veHNT and veDNTs have no price in the larger crypto markets.

## What Is the Network Utility Score?

The Network Utility score was described in [HIP-51](https://github.com/helium/HIP/issues/336) as the DAO Utility score and was updated with [HIP-88](https://github.com/helium/HIP/issues/707), and was then reduced in complexity with [HIP 141](https://github.com/helium/HIP/blob/main/0141-single-token-governance-and-release-proposals.md#migrating-to-a-protocol-score-based-only-on-delegation).

Every epoch, a specific amount of HNT is allocated to all subnetworks. Each subnetwork receives a share
of this fixed amount. The sizes of the shares are determined by the Utility Scores (also known as the 
Protocol score) of each subnetwork of Helium.

The new Protocol Score is derived from the share of veHNT delegated to each subnetwork (formerly 
represented by the V component of the Utility Score), as a percentage of total delegated veHNT. 
It determines the subnetwork’s percentage of total HNT emissions.

All locked veHNT positions will receive a share in the 6% of HNT emissions allocated to locked
HNT holders based on the proportion of veHNT they have to the total of veHNT held by everyone.

They are calculated daily and assigned to the lock-up position per epoch - daily. But can be claimed
to the wallet as convenient.

They may decrease when:

- HNT emissions are halved at the regular 2 year period (Next is 1st August 2025).
- More HNT is locked up or HNT that is locked up is locked for longer increasing the total veHNT.
- The daily Net Emissions total of HNT is decreasing.

They may increase when:

- Less HNT is locked up or HNT that is locked up is decaying decreasing the total veHNT.
- The daily Net Emissions total of HNT is increasing due to large HNT burns for data use.
