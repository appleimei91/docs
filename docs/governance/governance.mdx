## What is Helium Governance?

Helium governance exists to manage the process by which the network can be modified, whether in its
technical architecture, the token's economic model, or meta-governance changes. It is governed by
the global community of owners of Helium ([HNT](/tokens/hnt-token) tokens.

These token owners include Hotspot deployers, network users, wireless network operators, hardware 
manufacturers, network mappers and more. Tokens must be locked for voting on network changes, ensuring 
long-term stakeholder alignment.


Since the implementation of [HIP-141](https://github.com/helium/HIP/blob/main/0141-single-token-governance-and-release-proposals.md#votes-with-code) the governance process has changed. The Helium Community 
will vote with veHNT on a periodic basis (initially monthly) to approve upcoming protocol upgrades proposed 
by the Protocol Developers. This evolution of the HIP process may be characterized as a Helium Release Process
(HPR). 

All changes under this process must come with audited and deployable code. Each release vote will be initialized 
at the existing Helium Monthly [Community Call](https://helium.foundation/community-call), and will apply to new code deployed across the Helium network. 
Emergency or security-related deployments that are necessary for protocol safety, as well as bug fixes, may be 
deployed on an ad-hoc basis, but must be announced and ratified through subsequent votes.

Anyone can submit a Github PR to the latest [HRP](https://github.com/helium/helium-release-proposals) before
the community call but must submit such requests with completed and audited code for the implementation request.

Helium is a network of networks, all managed with one token for governance. Locking HNT allows for voting on 
governance of the top level Helium network and the subnetworks of IoT and Mobile with a single token.

The Helium Foundation serves as a steward for the governance process. The Foundation established the
initial framework and manages the open Helium GitHub repositories. The Foundation does not vote on
changes but does vet proposals for compliance with the law and technical feasibility. The Foundation's
role is to provide expert advice and guidance and to guide implementation of the results of votes after
they have passed.

Information about governance is subject to change as the Helium Network constantly evolves. It is
led by the open-source community that continues to build it.

governance, including specific HIPs, voting procedures, and working groups. Refer to the provided
links and resources.

1. **Discord**: The [Helium Discord](https://discord.gg/helium) platform serves as the primary
   communication channel for the Helium Network Community. It offers real-time discussions, support,
   and engagement opportunities.
2. **GitHub Repository**: The [HRP](https://github.com/helium/helium-release-proposals) repository and [HIP](https://github.com/helium/HIP) repository provides access
   to the Helium Release Proposals, Helium Improvement Proposals and related discussions.
3. **Social Media and Ecosystem Voices**: The Helium Foundation and various influencers on platforms
   like Twitter, Discord, and YouTube provide updates, debates, and explanations of HIPs and
   governance-related matters.
4. **Monthly Community Calls**: The Helium Community holds monthly video calls (led by the Helium
   Foundation). These typically happen on the 4th Wednesday of each month at Noon ET. Each call has
   an [open agenda](https://www.helium.foundation/community-call), and any community member can join
   and add items to the agenda to be discussed.
5. **Community Calendar**: The Helium Foundation maintains a calendar of ecosystem events and
   happenings. You can access and subscribe at:
   [www.helium.foundation/community-calendar](https://www.helium.foundation/community-calendar).

### Socials + Ecosystem Voices

As a network steward, the Helium Foundation posts important governance news, calls to vote, and more
on Twitter. [Follow @HeliumFndn](https://twitter.com/HeliumFndn) on Twitter to stay up to date.

As a decentralized network, numerous voices discuss governance, host debates, and explain HIPs in
layman's terms. You can find many of these influential voices in Discord, on Twitter, or on YouTube.
